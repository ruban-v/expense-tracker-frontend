4. View the expense in the list
5. Test edit and delete functionality
6. Note: Currently uses mock data since backend is not connected

## Next Steps for Backend Integration
1. Set up the backend server with the specified API endpoints
2. Implement proper JWT authentication
3. Create database schema for expenses table
4. Add proper error handling and validation
5. Test the complete flow with real data
